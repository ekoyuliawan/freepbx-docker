## Introduction

This is MVP [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) application for having [FreePBX](https://www.freepbx.org) - A Voice over IP manager for [Asterisk](https://www.asterisk.org), running in containers.

Upon starting this multi-container application, it will give you a turnkey PBX system for SIP calling.

* FreePBX 17.0.21
* PHP 8.2.29
* Asterisk 21.10.2
* MariaDB 10.11.14
* Fail2ban pre-configured with restrictive enforcement rules
* Email notifications
* Logrotate configured also for Asterisk and Freepbx
* Supports data persistence
* Base image Debian [debian:bookworm-slim](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/)
* Apache 2.4.65
* NodeJS v18.20.4
* DAHDI channel not supported

### Ports
The following ports are exposed via Docker.

| Port              | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| `80/tcp`          | HTTP        |
| `443/tcp`         | HTTPS       |
| `5060/udp`        | PJSIP       |

RTP ports e.g. `16384-32767/udp` require a particular configuration in order to be
properly exposed.\
There's a [known issue](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/11185) about Docker and its way to expose a large range of ports, since each port exposed loads another process into memory and you may be experiencing a low memory condition.\
As a trade-off, those ports are going to be exposed via Docker host `iptables` manually.\
So [run.sh](run.sh) will take care of iptables configuration, besides building and running the image.

### Host requirements
- `ip`, `iptables` and `awk` commands
- iptables rules inside the Docker chains will bypass any firewall rule on the system
- Iptables rules are temporary, unless you make them persistent in this way (Debian-like):
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y iptables-persistent
sudo systemctl enable netfilter-persistent
sudo systemctl restart netfilter-persistent
sudo systemctl status netfilter-persistent

# Everytime you make a change to iptables, remember to save to disk
sudo sh -c 'iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4'
```
- Customize Fail2ban preferences by editing the file `fail2ban/jail.local`. Currently it bans 2 consecutive failed SIP registration attempts within 30 seconds for 1 week.

- Make sure you have a valid DNS server for Docker containers by adding the following to `/etc/docker/daemon.json` (restart Docker after saving the file):
  ```json
  {
    "dns": ["1.1.1.1"]
  }
  ```

## Usage
1. Create required passwords:
```bash
# for MySQL root user
printf "notabeneNYA76" > mysql_root_password.txt
printf "notabeneNYA76" > freepbxuser_password.txt

# for Postfix
# run this command even if you don't need email notifications
printf "[smtp.gmail.com]:587 jsmemailnotifier@gmail.com:xhzfpirwpnjsdfhg" > sasl_passwd.txt

# Set proper file permissions
chmod 600 mysql_root_password.txt freepbxuser_password.txt sasl_passwd.txt
```

2. To complete postfix configuration, set the `relayhost` in [postfix/main.cf](source/postfix/main.cf) to match your SMTP server defined in `sasl_passwd.txt`. 

3. OPTION A: build the image from scratch:
```bash
cd source && sudo docker build -t your-image-name:your-tag .
```
Then edit the value of `services.freepbx.image` in the [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) by setting the proper image version and tag.

3. OPTION B: if you want to use the pre-built image on Docker Hub, jump to the next step directly

4. Configure RTP ports on the host and build + run the Compose project:
```bash
sudo bash run.sh
# If you want to override the default RTP port range (16384-32767):
sudo bash run.sh --rtp 10000-20000
# NOTE
# If you run the script with the default RTP range 16384-32767 and later rerun it with a different range, the iptables rules from the previous range remain in place and you have to delete those rules manually before or after applying the new range.

# Install Freepbx
sudo bash run.sh --install-freepbx

# Optional, clean up containers, network and volumes
sudo bash run.sh --clean-all
```

5. TLS support using Let's Encrypt DNS challenge
```bash
# Make sure to have both 80 and 443 TCP ports allowed by the firewall and a valid DNS record A
sudo docker compose exec -it freepbx certbot --apache -d your.domain.com --email your-email@email.com --agree-tos --redirect -n
```
